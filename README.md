# Kill Script For FiveM.

This is literally a simple script. I made it basically because I have seen many people needing to "kill themselves" due to server issues however they couldn't therefore I made this script.

# Installation

Simply drag and drop the script and start it in the server.cfg. 

</br>

# Command
The command is /kill
